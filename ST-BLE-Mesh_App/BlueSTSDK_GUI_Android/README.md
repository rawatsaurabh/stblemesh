# BlueSTSDK Gui

This library is built on top of the [BlueSTSDK](https://github.com/STMicroelectronicswq/BlueSTSDK_Android) library.

It extends the BlueSTSDK providing firmware update over bluetooth and a set of helper classes to build a consistent user interface among apps based on the BlueSTSDK library.

## How to include it

This library has some part in Kotlin, so add the Kotlin support to your project:
in the project build.gradle add:
```groovy
buildscript {
    
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.41' 

    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

To avoid version conflict with the dependency used by the application or other libraries, app all the dependency version must be defined into the project build.gradle.

To build the BlueSTSDK_GUI library you need to add:
```groovy
ext {
    // Sdk and tools
    targetSdkVersion = 28
    compileSdkVersion = 29
    buildToolsVersion = '29.0.1'

    // App dependencies
    androidx_annotationVersion='1.1.0'
    androidx_appCompatVersion='1.0.2'
    androidx_materialVersion='1.0.0'
    androidx_constraintLayoutVersion = '1.1.3'
    androidx_recycleViewVersion = '1.0.0'
    androidx_cardViewVersion = '1.0.0'
    androidx_recycleViewVersion = '1.0.0'
    androidx_lifecycleExtVersion = '2.0.0'

    // Test dependecy
    androidx_runnerVersion = '1.2.0'
    androidx_rulesVersion = '1.2.0'
    androidx_espressoVersion = '3.2.0'

    junitVersion = '4.12'
    mockitoVersion = '1.9.5'
}

```
